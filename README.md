**Flow** is a lightweight clone of agentic IDEs like Cursor and Windsurf. Built as a VSCode extension, this project helped me dive deep into understanding the inner workings of AI-powered development environments.

Through building **Flow**, I gained hands-on experience with the architecture and mechanisms that power modern intelligent IDEs.
